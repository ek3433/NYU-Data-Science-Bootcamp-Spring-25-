    "### 1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?\n",
    "You can assess statistical significance using null hypothesis testing where you:\n",
    "- Formulate a null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Collect data and compute a test statistic.\n",
    "- Calculate the p-value.\n",
    "- If the p-value < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)? Explain it. Why is it important?\n",
    "Assuming that samples are taken randomly and independently, the sample means distribute normally as the sample size increases, regardless of how the underlying population is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "- Allows for normal approximation of sampling distributions.\n",
    "- Enables valid use of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is statistical power?\n",
    "- The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- High power means lower chance of getting a false negative.\n",
    "- It is influenced by sample size, effect size, significance level, and data variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How do you control for biases?\n",
    "- Randomization is important to obtain identically and independently distributed samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What are confounding variables?\n",
    "- Variables other than the independent variable that affect the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is A/B testing?\n",
    "- A form of controlled experiment where users are randomly assigned to:\n",
    "  - Group A (control)\n",
    "  - Group B (treatment)\n",
    "- Compare group outcomes to assess if the treatment has a significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What are confidence intervals?\n",
    "- A range of plausible values for a population parameter.\n",
    "- A x% confidence interval means you'd expect the true value to fall within the range x out of 100 times.\n",
